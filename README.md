# DL Order Tracker - Deployment Instructions

## 📁 File Structure
Your Kanban app consists of these files that must be in the same folder:

```
your-app-folder/
├── index.html              (Main application file)
├── style.css               (Styling and theme)
├── script.js               (Functionality and drag-drop)
├── dl-wholesale-logo.png   (Your company logo)
├── background-pattern.png  (Tiled background pattern)
└── favicon.png             (Browser tab icon)
```

## 🖼️ Logo, Background, and Favicon Images
**IMPORTANT**: All image files MUST be in the same folder as your `index.html` file.

### For Wix Deployment:
1. Upload ALL files to the same directory in your Wix file manager
2. Make sure the logo file is named exactly: `dl-wholesale-logo.png`
3. Make sure the background file is named exactly: `background-pattern.png`
4. Make sure the favicon file is named exactly: `favicon.png`
5. Ensure all files are in the root directory of your web app

### For Local Testing:
- Keep all files in the same folder on your computer
- Open `index.html` in your browser to test

## ✅ What's Fixed in This Version:

### 🎯 Drag & Drop Improvements:
- **Less sensitive**: Increased delay before drag starts (300ms for touch, 50ms for mouse)
- **Better boundaries**: Added 20px padding around columns for easier dropping
- **Fixed right column**: Can now grab and drag orders from all columns including the far right
- **Improved touch**: Better touch handling for mobile devices with 30px padding
- **Smoother operation**: Reduced timing conflicts and flickering

### 🗑️ Windows-Style Delete Buttons:
- **Individual delete**: Each order has a red delete button with white 'X'
- **Windows-style design**: Looks exactly like Windows close buttons
- **Top-right position**: Positioned in the top-right corner of each order card
- **Hover to reveal**: Delete buttons appear when hovering over order cards
- **Instant deletion**: No confirmation dialog - orders delete immediately
- **Smooth animations**: Buttons scale and animate on hover/click

### 🎨 Visual Improvements:
- **Actual-size logo**: DL WHOLESALE logo displays at its natural size
- **Tiled background**: Subtle 25% transparent pattern across entire background
- **No header text**: Clean, minimal header design
- **No popup**: App loads directly without welcome message
- **Thicker glass**: Enhanced glass morphism effect throughout
- **Agriculture colors**: Earth-tone accent colors on all column borders
